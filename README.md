## Report 

In this GitHub project, Alex and I aim to predict the difficulty level of French texts using artificial intelligence. As native French speakers who have learned English, we understand the importance of engaging with texts that match our comprehension level. Learning with texts that are appropriately challenging can significantly enhance the learning process by introducing increasingly difficult material at a manageable pace.

With this in mind, we decided to develop a model that not only aids in language learning but also leverages our native fluency in French. Our goal is to determine the difficulty level of unfamiliar texts using the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) scale from A1 to C2. To achieve this, we have assembled a training dataset comprising 4,800 French sentences, each annotated with its actual difficulty level. Additionally, we will evaluate our modelâ€™s accuracy using an unlabeled dataset.
